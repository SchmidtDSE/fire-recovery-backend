# Command Pattern Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of the Command pattern to separate API concerns from business logic in the fire recovery backend. The refactoring addresses serverless compatibility issues, improves testability, and creates clear separation of concerns while adhering to SOLID principles.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified

#### 1. Mixed Concerns in API Layer
- **Location**: `src/routers/fire_recovery.py:179-241`
- **Issue**: HTTP handlers contain business logic, making them difficult to test and maintain
- **Impact**: Tight coupling between API and domain logic

#### 2. Local I/O Dependencies
- **Location**: `src/process/resolve_veg.py:18-48`
- **Issue**: Direct `tempfile` usage prevents serverless deployment
- **Impact**: Cannot run in distributed/serverless environments

#### 3. Hardcoded File System Operations
- **Location**: `src/process/spectral_indices.py:125-134`
- **Issue**: Local filesystem paths (`tmp/{job_id}`) hardcoded
- **Impact**: Not compatible with cloud-native architectures

#### 4. Overloaded Process Modules
- **Location**: `src/process/*`
- **Issue**: Single modules handling multiple responsibilities (I/O, computation, orchestration)
- **Impact**: Violates Single Responsibility Principle

#### 5. Incomplete Workflow Command Coverage
- **Location**: Missing commands for complete 7-step user workflow
- **Issue**: Only fire severity analysis has been extracted to command pattern
- **Impact**: Inconsistent architecture across the application

### Current Architecture Strengths

✅ **Strategy Pattern**: Well-implemented for spectral indices calculation
✅ **STAC Integration**: Clean separation using pystac library
✅ **Storage Abstraction**: Factory pattern for memory/minio storage
✅ **Dependency Injection**: IndexRegistry properly manages calculator dependencies
✅ **Command Infrastructure**: Robust command interfaces with lifecycle hooks
✅ **Command Registry**: Existing registry pattern for dependency injection
✅ **Result Handling**: Sophisticated CommandResult with factory methods

## Design Pattern Selection: Command Pattern

### Why Command Pattern?

The Command pattern is ideal for this refactoring because it:

1. **Encapsulates Business Operations**: Each fire recovery operation becomes a self-contained command
2. **Enables Undo/Redo**: Future requirement for operation rollback
3. **Supports Queuing**: Background task execution fits naturally
4. **Promotes Testability**: Commands can be unit tested in isolation
5. **Facilitates Logging**: Centralized execution monitoring
6. **Decouples Invoker from Receiver**: API layer doesn't need to know implementation details

### SOLID Principles Compliance

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each command handles exactly one business operation
- API controllers only handle HTTP concerns
- Storage classes only handle data persistence

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- New operations can be added as new commands without modifying existing code
- Command registry enables runtime command discovery

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All commands implement the same `Command` interface
- Commands are interchangeable through the common interface

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Commands only depend on interfaces they actually use
- Separate interfaces for different types of dependencies

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Commands depend on abstractions (storage interfaces, computation interfaces)
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level implementation details

The phased implementation approach minimizes risk while delivering incremental value. The existing strategy patterns for index calculation and STAC management integrate seamlessly with the new command architecture, preserving previous refactoring investments.

This design positions the codebase for future enhancements such as operation queuing, distributed processing, and advanced monitoring capabilities while adhering to software engineering best practices.
